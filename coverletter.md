Dear Hiring Manger,

My name is Joseph Somerville, and I am writing to apply for the software engineering position at your company. I am currently a computer science major at the University of Central Florida and I hope to pursue a career in software development. I am eager to learn more about your team and believe that the internship will provide me with valuable experience and skills that will help your team achieve its goals. My strong problem-solving skills, desire to work and lead teams, and analytical thinking ability will allow me to be a strong contributor to a software development team at your company. 

I am particularly drawn towards your company because it will give me the opportunity to enhance my skill set in coding an environment that fosters teamworking and critical thinking. I am eager to use my prior experience with telecommunications and circuit troubleshooting to assist you your mission to develop software.

My experiences with IT and telecom have prepared me to be a successful software developer. As a technician at Lumen I was responsible for troubleshooting telephone and internet connections over an aged copper infrastructure and had to come up with creative solutions to keep customers connected. Through this experience, I learned that there is always a solution to the problem, despite how dire it seems, which I know will be especially valuable in my work. After working at Lumen, I have developed excellent customer service and communication skills, and am prepared to work with people from all cultures and backgrounds, as the area that I worked in was diverse and had me working inside of customersâ€™ homes. Additionally, my work as a telecom technician has taught me about teamwork and how to ask for help when I need it. My experiences with IT troubleshooting will help me effectively solve technical problems.

Thank you for considering my application. I would love the opportunity to contribute to your team and make a meaningful impact on your project, as well as further build my skills in software development. Please contact me at xxx-xxx-xxxx or at myemail@gmail.com if you have any questions or need further information from me.

Best wishes,

Joseph Somerville
