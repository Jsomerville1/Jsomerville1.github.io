## About Me

My name is Joseph Somerville. I am a computer science student at the University of Central Florida with a strong interest in web and software development and work history in IT and telecom. Passionate about technology, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in computer science-related positions, namely software engineering roles.

My academic journey began with an A.A. in General Studies from Lake-Sumter State College, where I made the Dean's List and received the Foundation Scholarship. Upon completing my AA degree I transferred to UCF in the fall of 2022 where I am a current undergraduate student studying computer science. I plan to graduate Decemeber 2025.

In my pursuit of a computer science career, I have gained proficiency in programming languages like Python, C, JavaScript, C#, and Java and I am proficient with git and Github. I am also well versed in using software such as Visual Studio Code, intelliJ, cLion, and Unity.

My work history in the telecommunications and IT field has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in installing, troubleshooting, and repairing a wide range of services and technologies. This experience has honed my ability to collaborate with team members, manage daily workloads efficiently, and provide exceptional customer service. It has also given me a keen ability to troubleshoot complex problems that arise within any field that I am working in.

As a current computer science student at the University of Central Florida, I am excited to leverage my education, work experience, and technical skills to contribute to the success of innovative organizations in the software engineering field.
