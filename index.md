## About Me

I am a motivated and detail-oriented computer science student at the University of Central Florida, with a developing foundation in programming and work history in telecommunications. Passionate about technology, I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge in computer science-related positions, such as software engineering roles.

My academic journey began with an A.A. in General Studies from Lake-Sumter State College, where I made the Dean's List and received the Foundation Scholarship. Upon completing my AA degree I transferred to UCF in the fall of 2022 where I am a current undergraduate student studying computer science.

In my pursuit of a computer science career, I have gained proficiency in programming languages like Python and C, and I am skilled in operating systems such as Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. I am also well versed in using software such as Microsoft Office, Visual Studio Code, and Code Blocks.

My work history in the telecommunications field since 2011 has provided me with valuable hands-on experience in installing, troubleshooting, and repairing a wide range of telecommunication services and technologies. This experience has honed my ability to collaborate with other technicians, manage daily workloads efficiently, and provide exceptional customer service. It has also given me a keen ability to troubleshoot complex problems that arise within any field that I am working in.

My technical skills include expertise in handling various technology accessories, such as Cisco diagnostics, Cat3, Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6 cables, digital and analog volt/ohm meters, copper cable, HST3000 meters, TDR and OTDR, light meters, and TCP/IP troubleshooting. I also have experience using 3M Dynatel cable locators.

As a current computer science student at the University of Central Florida, I am excited to leverage my education, work experience, and technical skills to contribute to the success of innovative organizations in the computer science field.
