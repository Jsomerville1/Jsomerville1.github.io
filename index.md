## About Me

My name is Joseph Somerville. I'm a full stack developer and recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Central Florida with hands-on experience building and shipping production software for the U.S. Army Reserve.

As a Defense Innovation Summer Fellow through NSIN and the Defense Innovation Unit, I worked on Project Mercury — a cross-platform application modernizing administrative workflows for over 400 soldiers. I also served as Project Manager for an 11-member Agile team on Project Mercury for my senior design project, and personally delivered 80+ production tickets spanning React Native mobile development, Python back-end services on AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, RDS), and PostgreSQL database work.

 My contributions included engineering the AFTP and RST Utilization tracking features end-to-end across web and mobile, architecting a dynamic form field highlighting system for Pay Admin feedback, building out multi-stage audit logging, standardizing timezone logic across the full stack, and revamping the bulk BA date upload engine with validation and error handling. I also helped develop a new user onboarding tutorial system, and personally created new user tutorial videos for Army Reserve leaders, soldiers, and pay administators to reduce training time and and "knowledge" fade for periodic users of the application.

I'm proficient in Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C, and C#, and I work with frameworks and tools like React, React Native, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and AWS. I have a strong foundation in Agile development, CI/CD, and collaborative workflows using Git, GitHub, Jira, and Confluence.

I'm looking for software engineering roles where I can continue building impactful applications and contribute to teams solving real-world problems. I am interested in full stack, front end, or back end positions. I'm a fast learner especially when presented with real world problems, and I'm eager to contribute to software teams. I am looking for in office, hybrid, or remote positions within the continental United States. I am willing to relocate!
