So far, my portfolio page is coming along nicely. I have been able to register a custom domain name and am using Github Pages to host the website for free. I have used a custom Jekyll theme to create the overall look of the page, which has saved a great deal of trouble in trying to code something from scratch. It has also allowed me a great deal of control over how my portfolio looks, as I am not stuck with what could be a limited website building tool.

I am happy with the page layout and ease of navigation. So far there is not much here, but what is here is easy to find. It looks professional, and it is easy to figure out what each button does. The fonts are clear and easy to read, and the navigation bar up top makes site navigation easy.

During the process of creating this website I have learned a lot about Jekyll and Github Pages, as well as about how pushing changes to github projects works. I have been using github desktop to push changes to my website by updating the repository directly and this has made things very easy. When I was younger and experimented with building websites I used to have to log in via ftp and change things manually, and this way is much easier.

As for what has been difficult, understanding how to make changes to Jekyll themes has been a bit daunting. However with a bit of grit I have been able to figure it out for the most part. That is, if this blog post actually updates properly and goes live!
