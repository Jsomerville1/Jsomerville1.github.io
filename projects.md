 Below you will find a list of projects that I have worked on or am currently working on.


### Touch Grass

###### Engineering Entrepreneurship Group Project

Touch Grass is project for an entrepreneurship class that implementes the Lean startup method. We focus on user and partner research and interviews in order to determine product viability before a single dollar is spent on development. Touch Grass is a mobile application that connects people looking for outdoor adventures and activities with those that are organizing these events or have experience and can offer a guiding hand.

### Ready Pet Go

###### Shell Hacks 2023

Ready Pet Go is a Tinder style interface for finding shelter animals that was implemented using Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, and auth0. This was my and my teams first hackathon and while we didn't get everything implemented, we were able to utilize PetFinder.com's API to pull images and descriptions of pets and implement them into our interface.
